    -Tasks:
          1). research player/npc pathing
          2). create 'statrt' screen
          3). Be super comfortable with GitKraken
          
        *I started Sprint 1 by looking into the Godot Engine and its game-creating capabilities after Brandon suggested we use it for the project. 
        After reading up on Godot, my vision for the game design was comparable to PacMan: a player must navigate tight hallways and pick up items (cards) while avoiding enemies (bouncers) chasing him/her.
        Despite never creating a game before, I understood that implementing a “competent” enemy with reasonable pathing to the player would be tricky. After excessive research in Sprint 1, I can definitively say that it is very tricky. 
        I also made a “Start Screen” scene.

    -Tasks:
          1). create npc "bouncer" avatar
          2). Learn how godot works
          3). create game over screen
        *Began with looking for a bouncer sprite, however there is not much out there, so I will end up modifing a exist character sprite into a bouncer.
        Looked up tutorials for godot and how the enviornment works.
        Created an endscreen scene

## Overview
TeamIO was formed during the Spring 2022 semester at Texas State University with the goal of building a game around the aspect of gambling in a non-traditional way that truly shows how ridiculous gambling really is. This game can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people, including those not particularly experienced in gambling.

## General Information
TeamIO is comprised of Brandon Abundis, Ronaldo Amaya, Galo Conde, and James Helgren.

In effort of making the game more appealing to non-gamblers we modified the rules of traditional Black Jack and then placing those rules into a game that doesn't even resembel a traditional Black Jaack Game, where players can interact with objects that show cards and bouncers who try to get you out when playing againts oppenents during gameplay. There is also absurd events that can happen that could break the Black Jack game like uno taking over. Think BlackJack, Uno, and PacMan had baby.

After making the game more appealing to a larger audience the secondary goal of our gaming platform was to provide the excitement of making wagers with friends without promoting detrimental side effects such as gambling addiction. To this end we developed a ranking system by which players, before gameplay begins,  can quickly cast votes to quantify the value of non-monetary prices (e.g. cooking dinner, ride to school, etc), distribute credits amongst players according the agreed value of the favor their are waging, and use the respectively allotted credits in wagers. Thus, users can feel the excitement of gambling without the stress of waging and potentially losing real money. 

Our intetion was to create a fun game for everyone to play 21 without having to pay real money and without trying to risk them getting addicted to that game.


## Technologies Used
- Discord
- Godot game engine
- GitKraken
- Youtube

## Features
- Game functionality for the BlackJack game with a twist: 
	* The JackBlack game is not nessesarly a proper blackjack game, but it has the premise of one.
	* There are scenes in godot that do a veraity of things from being the game world, to just being stats place holder for a node.
	* Scripts are not scenes, but are necessary component for the whole function of the game.
- The visual look of the game
	* There are multiple png files called sprites holding templates for character movement and static world objects
	* Animimation is an important factor to scenes as they use sprites to convey life to enemy scenes and random object exploding.


## Setup

## Next Steps
- Galo
	- Going to have to improve the code that allows the cards to be given to the dealer and player.
	- Will have to implement the card dealing to the new button implementaion.
	- Find a way to get the cards to visually show up on the screen somehow.
- Brandon
	- Create a new level area, or to make a new scene at least.
	- If making a new scene is too much, then implement a door mechanic for new room.
	- Somehow finish the game, or at least have a fun to play game working.
- James
	- Finish the money system, as it was much harder in scope than I thought.
	- Place coins in boxes, so that the player can gain more money.
	- Have the amount of money the player has show in the UI.
- Ronaldo
	- finds some sprites for card, so that they may be displayed visually.
	- might have to make more custom sprites for the game, or improve the detail of the current ones.
	- find more casino furniture sprites to give the world more consistency

## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.
- Brandon:
- Ronny: I can improve in getting more familiar with the Godot code itself.
- Galo:
- James: I can improve by continuing to familiarize myself with proper object-oriented design techniques and re-reading the Godot Docs.
TODOS

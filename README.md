## Overview
Team IO was formed during the Spring 2022 semester at Texas State University with the goal of building a game around the aspect of gambling in a non-traditional way that truly shows how ridiculous gambling really is. This game can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people, including those not particularly experienced in gambling.

## General Information
TeamIO is comprised of Brandon Abundis, Ronaldo Amaya, Galo Conde, and James Helgren.

In the effort of making the game more appealing to non-gamblers, we modified the rules of traditional BlackJack and then placed those rules into a game that doesn't even resemble a traditional Black Jack Game, where players can interact with objects that show cards and bouncers who try to get you out when playing against opponents during gameplay. There are also absurd events that can happen that could break the BlackJack game like UNO taking over. Think BlackJack, Uno, and PacMan had a baby.

After making the game more appealing to a larger audience the secondary goal of our gaming platform was to provide the excitement of making wagers with friends without promoting detrimental side effects such as gambling addiction. To this end we developed a ranking system by which players, before gameplay begins,  can quickly cast votes to quantify the value of non-monetary prices (e.g. cooking dinner, riding to school, etc), distribute credits amongst players according to the agreed value of the favor they are waging, and use the respectively allotted credits in wagers. Thus, users can feel the excitement of gambling without the stress of waging and potentially losing real money. 

We intended to create a fun game for everyone to play 21 without having to pay real money and without trying to risk them getting addicted to that game.


## Technologies Used

## Features
- Game functionality for the BlackJack game with a twist: 
	* This version of a JackBlack game is not necessarily a traditional adaptation of blackjack, but it at its core, it shares the features of one.
	* In Godot there are scenes that are the fundamental canvsas of the front end, everything you see is a scene that is loaded with a finite amount of nodes that represent objects in that scene.
	* Scripts are the backend of this game, and interaction that these node perform on the frontend are dependent on the scripts to compile correctly.
- The visual look of the game
	* There are multiple png files called sprites holding templates for character movement and static world objects.
	* Animation is an important factor in scenes as they use sprites to convey life to enemy scenes and random objects exploding.

- **How to run!**
	- `Step 1: Godot UI`
	    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/CbWllhq.gif)
		- Open the Godot application 
		- In the initial Godot menu, there should be a button called `import` on the far-middle right of the screen, and click it.
		- There will be a prompt to *Import Existing Project*, in which you will click the `Browse` button and navigate to where you cloned the repo.
		- When you have navigated to the cloned repo file location, it is **Important** to find a file called `project.godot`, then you will double click on that file.
		- You will be sent back to the prompt, and there should be a green checkmark to indicate that Godot recognizes this file as legitimate.
		- Then you will click on the `Import and Edit` button.
		- Congrats, you opened the games editor.
	- `Step 2: How to run the Game!`
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2OhVhjl.gif)
		- After successfully following step 1, you will be sent to the games editor.
		- On the very far top-right of the screen, you will see buttons that look like play, pause, and stop in this order.
		- You will click on the play button, which is a sideways triangle, and the game will compile and start.
		- Now that the game is running, you will navigate the menu using the arrow keys, or the `W-A-S-D` keys.
		- The `Space` key is the input and attack button, the only exception is the level menu, which is the `E` key.
		- The `Tab` key will show a pop-up menu to exit the game when stuck.

## Next Steps
- Galo
	- Going to have to improve the code that allows the cards to be given to the dealer and player.
	- Will have to implement the card dealing with the new button implementation.
	- Find a way to get the cards to visually show up on the screen somehow.
- Brandon
	- Create a new level area, or make a new scene at least.
	- If making a new scene is too much, then implement a door mechanic for a new room.
	- Somehow finish the game, or at least have a fun playing game working.
- James
	- Finish the money system, as it was much harder in scope than I thought.
	- Place coins in boxes, so that the player can gain more money.
	- Have the amount of money the player has show in the UI.
- Ronaldo
	- finds some sprites for all 52 cards, so that they may be displayed visually.
	- might have to make more custom sprites for the game, or improve the detail of the current ones.
	- find more casino furniture sprites to give the world more consistency

## Next Steps
- Brandon
	- For the levels, I would increase the depth of traversal, like going outside and implementing more interactive elements.
	- Implement sounds in the game, like hit, walk, and destroy sound effects.
	- Add visual health bars to show how much health an enemy AI has.
- Ronaldo
	- Expand upon enemy sprites like detail and animation.
	- Find sound effects for the improved Enemy sprites.
	- Would actually want to complete the game.
- Galo
	- Find a way for the cards to stack; to visually tell you how many cards you have on hand.
	- Make the dealer's cards only show after the player hits the "stay" button.
	- Add a simple counter on the Ui that shows you how close you are to 21.
- James
	- Fix the position depth of the animated coin, so that the player model can accurately be behind or in front of the coin.
	- Find a money effect when you win a hand and a money loss effect when the player loses.
	- Implement a way for the player to move on to the next room when you win enough hands.

## Room for Improvement
- This was everybody’s first time making a game as a project, and our ambition exceeded our game development capabilities.
- Godot’s documentation is limited and sparse; the lack of guidance left us to largely experimenting with code to solve problems.
- The Godot Engine community is small, which means we really went into this project blind with vague online solutions scattered across the Internet.
- Learning how to animate and the connection of animation to code took us a considerable amount of time.


## Project Status
Project is: in-progess
- Brandon: I wish I was better at game development, so that this game can be more awesome.
- Ronny: I would like to continue working on this project at some point in the future (hopefully close) so we can see the completed version of the game.
- Galo:
- James: I will continue working on this project as a hobby. I also wish to eventually implement a multiplayer element for the game.
